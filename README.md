# Stereo Vision Based Robotic Manipulator
## Projected Goals
* Build robotic manipulator that has 4 or more DOFs
* Implement motion planning
* Implement path control that controls the end effector twist
* Detect Objects' position and orientation information (jenga blocks for this project) with stereo vision camera
* Automatically stack jenga blocks with the robotic manipulator aided by stereo vision


# Main Equipments and Material Used
* Arbotix-M controller
* PC
* 4x Dynamixel ax-12a servo motors
* FTDI cable
* 12v power supply
* ZED camera
# Simulation
## *Inverse Kinematics of a 3 Linkages Manipulator*
